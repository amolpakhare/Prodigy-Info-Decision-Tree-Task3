# Prodigy-Info-Decision-Tree-Task3

This repository documents my internship project at Prodigy InfoTech, focusing on data analysis and predictive modeling. The primary goal of this project was to build a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchasing behavior using the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Bank Marketing dataset. It includes various attributes related to customers, such as age, job, marital status, education, and previous contact results.
Data Cleaning and Analysis
The data cleaning process included:

Handling missing values.
Converting categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot encoding.
Normalizing numerical features to improve model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution of features was analyzed through visualizations.
Key patterns and correlations were identified using graphs such as histograms and scatter plots.
Model Building
A decision tree classifier was built using Scikit-learn.
Hyperparameters were tuned for optimal performance.
The data was split into training and testing sets for evaluation.
Results
The model's performance was evaluated using:

Accuracy: X%
Precision: X%
Recall: X%
F1 Score: X%
Confusion matrices were utilized to visualize the classification results.

Knowledge Gained
Through this project, I gained valuable insights and skills:

Proficient in building and tuning decision tree classifiers.
Enhanced data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
Improved understanding of customer behavior through data analysis.
